title: Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II
---

A special anti-Godzilla unit, "G-Force," forms to combat the monster. They
salvage the remains of Mecha-King Ghidorah, a cyborg monster from the future.
They reverse engineer the technology to develop powerful new anti-Godzilla
weapons. The first prototype weapon, _Garuda_, fails to impress the military
brass. The second project, Mechagodzilla, is much more successful and becomes
the primary countermeasure. Aoki, a _Garuda_ engineer, gets shunted to the
Mechagodzilla project to train as a pilot. Meanwhile, an expedition in the
Bering Sea uncovers a preserved dinosaur egg. Rodan, a surviving pterosaur,
attacks the expedition. Godzilla appears and fights Roman while the expedition
escapes with the egg.

Azusa, a technician, studies the dinosaur egg at her lab. She discovers that the
egg emits psychic signals. The egg hatches into a baby _Godzillasaur_, which bonds
to Azusa. Godzilla appears on the mainland and heads towards Azusa's lab.
Mechagodzilla deploys to stop Godzilla, but Godzilla overpowers it and continues
unimpeded. Godzilla fails to find the baby dinosaur and returns to the ocean.
G-Force relocates the baby dinosaur, now called "Baby," to a secure facility.
While Azusa tends to it, G-Force plots to use Baby to lure Godzilla into a trap.
Aoki proposes docking _Garuda_ onto Mechagodzilla to increase its attack power.
G-Force approves and Aoki returns to the _Garuda_ project.

G-Force transports Baby ahead of their next operation. Roman returns and
intercepts the transport, kidnapping both Baby and Azusa. Mechagodzilla and
_Garuda_ launch on a rescue mission. Mechagodzilla defeats Rodan, but must then
turn to face Godzilla. _Garuda_ docks with Mechagodzilla and they subdue Godzilla
with their combined firepower. Mechagodzilla paralyzes Godzilla with specialized
shock cables. Rodan uses the last of its energy to revive Godzilla. Godzilla
unleashes an energy attack that destroys Mechagodzilla, forcing the crew to
eject. Aoki and Azusa reunite and release Baby from captivity. Baby bonds with
Godzilla and the two monsters return to the sea.
