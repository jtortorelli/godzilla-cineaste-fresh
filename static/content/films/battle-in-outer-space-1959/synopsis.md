title: Battle in Outer Space
---

Hostile alien invaders destroy a manned Earth satellite. They cause a series of
strange catastrophes on the surface to soften it up for an invasion. The Space
Research Center convenes a special meeting to deal with the threat, known as the
Natal. The SRC unveils futuristic weaponry it has been developing to use against
the aliens. They identify a Natal base on the moon and send a strike force to
destroy it.

The strike force is successful and liberates the moon from Natal control. The
Natal recover and move forward with the invasion of Earth. The SRC distributes
anti-alien countermeasures to the major cities in preparation. The Natal rain
down meteorite bombs while their fleet approaches. The Natal mothership itself
follows behind.

The SRC sorties rocket jets against the Natal vanguard. The Mothership breaks
through the blockade and attacks Tokyo. The Natal use an anti-gravity beam to
tear up swaths of the city, flinging cars and buildings all around. The Japanese
focus their countermeasures on the Mothership and destroy it. When the dust
settles, the SRC confirms they have neutralized the Natal. They plan further
space exploration to secure the solar system against future threats.
