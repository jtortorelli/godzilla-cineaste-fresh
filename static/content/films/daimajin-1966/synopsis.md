title: Daimajin
---

Samanosuke, a retainer of the Hanabusa clan, rebels and slays his lord. The
lord's children, Tadafumi and Kozasa, escape with Kogenta, the lord's servant.
They retreat to the forbidden mountain, the refuge of the angry mountain god
Daimajin. Over the next ten years Samanosuke continues to grow in power and
dominates the region. Tadafumi is now mature and Kogenta decides it's time to
reclaim the land for Hanabusa.

Kogenta ventures into the city to spy out the castle. Samanosuke's men recognize
him and capture him. Tadafumi is also captured when he attempts to rescue
Kogenta. Samanosuke learns the whereabouts of Kozasa and sends his men to
capture her, too. When they arrive, they desecrate Daimajin's statue and incur
his wrath. The statue awakens and heads for the castle, laying waste to
Samanosuke's forces. Daimajin frees Kogenta and Tadafumi, but grabs Samanosuke
and slays him.

Daimajin's wrath does not abate with Samanosuke's death. The statue continues
its path of destruction through the village despite Tadafumi's pleas. Finally,
Kozasa prays to Daimajin to end its violence. Daimajin's spirit departs and the
statue crumbles to dust.
