title: Assault Girls
---

In the future, the economy collapses and people become absorbed in virtual
reality. The top game is a military simulation game called "Avalon." Avalon has
a massive player base, but only a few reach the level known as Avalon(f).
Avalon(f) is a challenging level where players must hunt for sand whales for
points. The largest sand whale, Madara, is worth enough points to boost players
to the next mystery level.

Four players roam Avalon(f): Jäger, Grey, Colonel, and Lucifer. Jäger is a
sniper, Grey is a pilot, Colonel is a combat specialist, and Lucifer is a mage.
They've been struggling to defeat Madara for months. The game master warns them
that Madara is impossible for a single player to defeat. The game master advises
them to join forces, although they will have split up the points. Jäger
distrusts the other players and refuses. Grey defeats him in repeated duels
until he finally relents.

Grey, Colonel, and Lucifer distract Madara while Jäger sets up his shot. Their
combined attacks subdue Madara for a moment, and Jäger hits it with a kill shot.
Jäger celebrates, but the other three immediately betray him and race for their
home base to cash the points. Jäger goes postal and destroys their vehicles,
sparking a four-way shootout. The players end up fighting each other with more
ferocity than they did the sand whales.
