title: Daigoro vs. Goliath
---

Six years ago, a nuclear submarine accident awoke a vicious monster. The
military destroyed the monster, but its egg hatched into a baby monster. The
country felt sorry for the orphaned monster, and so they decided to raise it as
a national treasure. Saito, a zookeeper, is the monsterâ€™s personal caretaker.
The monster, named Daigoro, grows too big for a conventional pen. Saito has him
moved to a nearby island. Daigoro must also eat a supplement that stunts his
growth, so he does not exhaust his food budget.

A meteorite falls from the sky, bringing with it a giant blue ice monster,
Goliath. Goliath fights Daigoro and overpowers him. Daigoro, in his
half-starved, weakened state, is no match for the vicious space monster. Goliath
reaches the mainland, and the military is helpless to defeat him. It now seems
that Daigoro is the only one capable of beating Goliath, if only he were
stronger.

A kindly inventor, Oji-_san_, wins a TV contest and donates the reward to Daigoro.
Saito uses the funds to secure a healthier diet for Daigoro. He also teaches
Daigoro how to breath fire. Oji-_san_ also realizes that Goliath uses his horn to
channel energy for his attacks. He invents a special cloth to suppress Goliath's
power and manages to wrap it around his horn. Goliath awakens and comes to
shore, where Daigoro meets him in combat. Daigoro lands a knockout blow on
Goliath and wins the fight. The military straps Goliath to a rocket and fires
him back into space. Daigoro is free now to keep growing into an adult monster
under Saito's care.
