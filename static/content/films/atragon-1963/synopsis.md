The Empire of Mu, which sank under the sea thousands of years ago, plots to
retake the surface. Mu agents accost Kusumi, a retired admiral, and try to
kidnap him. The attempt fails, and Mu delivers an ultimatum to Japan. They are
searching for Captain Jinguji, Kusumi's war comrade. Although Jinguji has been
long though dead, Mu pressure Japan to find him, or else they will attack.

Kusumi's ward, Makoto, is Jinguji's daughter. The police capture a vagrant who
had been tailing her. The vagrant, a soldier in disguise, reveals that Jinguji
is alive and sent him. He takes Kusumi and Makoto to Jinguji's secret island
base in the South Pacific. Jinguji unveils the _Gotengo_, his super submarine.
The Muans discover the base, too, and destroy it, kidnapping Makoto in the
process. Then the Muans launch their all-out attack on the surface.

The Mu attack levels Tokyo and destroys most of the navy. Jinguji's men salvage
the _Gotengo_ and launch a counterattack. They rescue Makoto and captured the Mu
Empress. The haughty empress believes that Mu is invincible, but Jinguji knows
their weakness. The _Gotengo_ penetrates Mu's reactor room, the heart of the
empire. Jinguji's crew disembarks and plants bombs on the reactor. The explosion
causes a chain reaction that incinerates Mu. The humiliated Mu Empress throws
herself overboard to perish with her empire.
