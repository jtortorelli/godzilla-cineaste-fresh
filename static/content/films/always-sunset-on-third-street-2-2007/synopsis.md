---

Chagawa, a struggling novelist, raises Junnosuke from his home on Third Street.
He pines for his fiancée, Hiromi. Hiromi has left Third Street and returned to
exotic dancing to pay off her debts. Unable to face Chagawa, she contemplates
moving to Osaka with one of her adoring patrons. Junnosuke is the illegitimate
son of wealthy businessman Kawabuchi. Kawabuchi desires to take custody of
Junnosuke and make him his heir. The residents of Third Street rebuff him, and
he relents for the time being.

Chagawa learns that Junnosuke has been missing lunch at school so they can keep
eating rice at home. Kawabuchi also learns of the situation and summons Chagawa.
Kawabuchi is departing for a business trip and gives Chagawa an ultimatum.
Chagawa must find the means to provide for Junnosuke, or Kawabuchi will take him
when he returns. Chagawa decides to enter the Akutagawa Literature Prize
contest. The judges select Chagawa as a finalist and reprint his submission in
their journal.

Kawabuchi returns, and Chagawa learns that he did not win the grand prize.
Chagawa agrees to honor his agreement with Kawabuchi and relinquish Junnosuke.
Meanwhile, Hiromi abandons her Osaka plans and returns to Third Street to be
with Chagawa. She had read Chagawa’s submission and realized it was a love
letter to her. Kawabuchi observes their reunion and allows Junnosuke to stay. He
departs Third Street satisfied that Junnosuke will grow up in a loving
household.
