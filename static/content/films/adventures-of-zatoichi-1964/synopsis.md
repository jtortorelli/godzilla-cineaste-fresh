title: Adventures of Zatoichi
---

Zatoichi travels to visit a mountain village to partake of the new year’s
festivities. The village inn is at capacity so he must share a room with two
women. One is Saki, who is searching for her father, and the other is Osen, who
is waiting for her brother Shinsuke. Shinsuke took a job from the yakuza to
assassinate a nearby village chief. Jinbei, the local yakuza boss, and the
corrupt magistrate, sold him out to the authorities, and now he is on the lam.
Jinbei has secured the services of Gonosuke, a ronin who longs to duel with
Zatoichi.

Zatoichi accompanies the women to protect them both from Jinbei’s schemes. When
Osen attempts to rendezvous with Shinsuke, Jinbei’s men appear and attack.
Zatoichi rescues Osen, but the yakuza give Shinsuke a mortal blow. Shinsuke
confesses to the assassination of the village chief, who was Saki’s father.
Ashamed of her brother’s actions, Osen chooses to flee the village rather than
face Saki. It falls on Zatoichi to break the news to Saki. He sends Saki away
from the village, but Jinbei’s men overtake her palanquin and kidnap her.

Zatoichi learns of Saki’s predicament and raids the guardhouse to free her. He
turns on the magistrates foot soldiers and slaughters them. Gonosuke arrives and
duels him, but falls to Zatoichi’s lightning blade. Zatoichi corners and
executes Jinbei for his crimes and then flees to the mountain top. The next
morning Zatoichi meditates and worships the first light of the new year.
