title: Gamera vs. Barugon
---

Ichiro, a war vet, discovered an opal while stationed in New Guinea, and hid it
in a cave. He recruits his younger brother Keisuke and his friend Onodera to go
and find it again. Keisuke and Onodera go to New Guinea and find the opal, but
Onodera betrays Keisuke and seals him in the cave. Onodera's ship sinks in Osaka
Bay and he loses the Opal. A large monster, Barugon, appears from the bay and
attacks Osaka. Ichiro confronts Onodera, and Onodera kills him. Gamera, the
flying turtle monster, returns to Earth and fights Barugon. Barugon defeats
Gamera with its freezing attacks.

Keisuke returns to Japan accompanied by Karen, a native who rescued him. Barugon
is the fierce deity of her tribe, and the "opal" was actually its egg. Barugon
has a weakness for pure gems. Karen has brought a diamond with her to Japan the
natives meant to use against Barugon. Barugon is also unable to survive being in
water. The military tries to lure Barugon into a lake using the diamond as bait.
Onodera sabotages the plan and steals the diamond, but Barugon consumes them
both.

The military attempts a last ditch attack to reflect Barugon's energy attacks
back at him. The attack is successful in wounding Barugon. Gamera revives and
returns to the battlefield. Gamera kills Barugon by dragging him into Lake Biwa.
Barugon drowns and disintegrates, and Gamera departs. Keisuke and Karen decide
to remain in Japan and start a new life together.
