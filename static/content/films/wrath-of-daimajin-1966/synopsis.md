title: Wrath of Daimajin
---

The warlord Arakawa invades a nearby village and abducts all their young men. He
puts them to work as slaves in his mountain fortress. The distraught villagers
discover a secret path across their feared Majin Mountain. This path would let
them infiltrate Arakawa's domain so they can rescue their men. The villagers are
either too old or too young to make the journey, though, and they lost hope.
Four of the village boys - Tsurukichi, Kinta, Daisaku, and Sugimatsu - sneak out
of the village on their own.

The boys spot a hawk, an emissary of the god of the mountain, and follow it
along the safe path. They reach the statue of Daimajin at the summit, where the
scouts of Arakawa spot them. The scouts pursue the boys all the way down the
other side of the mountain. Kinta dies during a perilous river crossing. A
fierce blizzard hinders the boys' progress, and the scouts close in on them. The
hawk attacks first and kills the scouts, but then dies from its injuries.
Tsurukichi buries the hawk and then casts himself from a cliff to appease the
god of the mountain. The statue of Daimajin awakens and saves Tsurukichi, and
then turns toward Arakawa.

Daimajin arrives at Arakawa's fortress and destroys his army. The statue
captures Arakawa himself and slays him by throwing him into a boiling hot
spring. Daimajin's wrath abates and the statue dissolves into the snow. The
freed slaves join the boys and return to their village.
