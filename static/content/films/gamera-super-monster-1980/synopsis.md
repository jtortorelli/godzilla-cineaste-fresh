title: 'Gamera: Super Monster'
---

The Zanon, a vicious intergalactic being, approaches Earth, intending to conquer
it. He sends his servant Giruge to scout the Earth. They learn that there are
already three space women living on Earth, which pose a threat to their plans.
The space women, led by Kilara, are aware of Zanon and hide from him. Kilara
meets Keiichi, who adopts a turtle from her pet shop. After a short while
Keiichi decides to release the turtle back into the while. Immediately the
turtle transforms into Gamera, the flying turtle monster. Gamera patrols Earth
to ward off attacks from Zanon.

Zanon dispatches Gyaos to destroy Japan. Gamera battles with Gyaos, defeating
it. Zanon continues sending monsters to try and destroy Gamera. Giruge tries to
smoke out the space women. She finds Keiichi and follows him in disguise to meet
Kilara. Kilara's virtue causes Giruge to regret her actions. Giruge sacrifices
herself to protect Kilara from Zanon.

Gamera flies into space to confront Zanon head on, meeting more monsters along
the way. Finally Gamera collides with Zanon's ship, and they both disappear in a
huge explosion. Keiichi mourns for Gamera, and Kilara cheers him up by flying
him around Tokyo.
