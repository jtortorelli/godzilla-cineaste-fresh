title: Gamera, the Giant Monster
---

A skirmish between the superpowers in the Arctic causes a nuclear explosion. The
detonation awakens Gamera, a giant prehistoric turtle monster. Gamera destroys a
research vessel and disappears into the ocean. Dr. Hidaka, a survivor of the
expedition, thinks Gamera will die of radiation poisoning. Gamera surprises him
by reappearing off the coast of Japan. The monster is impervious to conventional
military weapons. Hidaka theorizes that since Gamera feeds on fire, they can
defeat it with cold. The military uses a freezing weapon against Gamera, and it
seems effective. Gamera sprouts powerful flames from its body to flee.

Gamera returns and attacks Tokyo. The military stokes fires in the refinery
district to distract him. Hidaka meets with other scientists to devise a plan
for eliminating Gamera. They decide to proceed with Plan Z, and stage the
operation on Oshima Island. The military uses oil slicks lit on fire to guide
Gamera to Oshima. A typhoon threatens to put out their fires, and Gamera loses
interest. The island's volcano erupts and entices Gamera to make landfall.

Hidaka and the military lure Gamera to the site of Plan Z. They trap Gamera in
an overside capsule. A rocket booster lifts the capsule high into the
atmosphere, and into space. The scientists realized that they could not defeat
Gamera on Earth, so they sent him away instead.
