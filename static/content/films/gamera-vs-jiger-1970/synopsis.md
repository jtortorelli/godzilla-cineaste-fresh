title: Gamera vs. Jiger
---

Artifacts from around the world are being flown to Japan for exhibition at the
1970 World Expo. One such artifact is the Devil's Whistle, a statue from a
remote African island. There is a strong taboo against disturbing the statue.
When the excavators remove it, the monster Jiger appears and pursues the statue
to Japan. Jiger appears in Osaka, and so does Gamera, the flying turtle monster.
Jiger uses a stinger to weaken Gamera, who collapses. Jiger retakes the Devil's
Whistle and throws it into the ocean.

A pair of kids abscond with a mini sub and use it to travel inside of Gamera.
They discover a smaller Jiger living inside of Gamera, a parasite left by the
large Jiger. They also discover that Jiger is vulnerable against radio waves.
The boys use their radio to kill the small Jiger and share their knowledge with
the military. The military use radio waves to pin the large Jiger while they
revive Gamera.

Gamera awakes and fights Jiger again, but Jiger is still too strong. Gamera
dives in the ocean and recovers the Devil's Whistle, the only object able to
defeat Jiger. He defeats Jiger by impaling it on the statue. Gamera carries the
statue and Jiger back to the island they came from.
