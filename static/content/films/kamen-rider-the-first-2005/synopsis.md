title: 'Kamen Rider: The First'
---

An underground terrorist organization, Shocker, attempts to influence world
events through assassination. Shocker employs an elite force of cyborg super
soldiers to carry out its missions. Shocker abducts Hongo, a research professor,
to become their latest soldier. The cyborg Hongo, code named "Hopper," goes out
on Shocker missions. Asuka, a reporter, is tracking the murders and is close to
exposing Shocker. Hopper and "Spider," another cyborg, target Asuka for
assassination. Hopper malfunctions during the mission and becomes Hongo again.
Hongo tries to fight off Spider and saves Asuka, but is too late to save her
fiancé, Katsuhiko. Spider tries again to abduct Asuka, but Hongo returns and
kills him. Hongo now finds himself on the run from Shocker.

Asuka later encounters Ichimonji, a doppelgänger for the dead Katsuhiko.
Ichimonji is actually a new Shocker agent made to look like Katsuhiko. He woos
Asuka to get close to her and learn more about Hongo, his target. Ichimonji
admires Asuka and tries to convince Shocker to let her live if he kills Hongo.
In retaliation, Shocker sends "Snake" and "Cobra" to deal with Ichimonji. Hongo
rescues Ichimonji, much to Ichimonji's disgust, and now they are both fugitives.

Shocker finally abducts Asuka, forcing a showdown with Hongo and Ichimonji. They
raid Shocker's island base, and defeat Snake and Cobra, Shocker's last line of
defense. Hongo rescues Asuka, and Ichimonji concedes that Hongo is the better
man.
