title: The Golden Bat
---

A rogue planet, Icarus, threatens to collide with Earth. Icarus is being
manipulate by the alien Nazo and his advanced technology. Dr. Pearl, an
astronomer, realizes the danger and constructs a heat ray to destroy Icarus. He
requires a crucial lens to finish the weapon, and he sends a team to gather the
materials. Nazo attacks the expedition in the South Pacific and they seek
shelter in an ancient ruin. Inside they discover the tomb of the Golden Bat, a
superhuman Atlantean warrior. The Golden Bat awakens and defeats Nazo's minions.
He allows the team to take a precious gem from his treasure to use in Dr.
Pearl's heat ray.

Nazo sends his lieutenants to infiltrate Dr. Pearl's lab and steal the heat ray.
Pearl disables the heat ray by removing the crucial lens and hiding it. Nazo
kidnaps Dr. Pearl and his assistants and holds them hostage. He forces Golden
Bat to surrender the lens in exchange for Pearl's life. Nazo sends his minions
to destroy Golden Bat, but they are no match for him. Golden Bat cripples Nazo's
ship, stranding him on Earth in Icarus' path.

The Golden Bat and Nazo duel aboard Nazo's ship, where the Golden Bat wins by
impaling the alien with his scepter. The Golden Bat recovers the heat ray in
time for Dr. Pearl to use it on Icarus. The heat ray destroys Icarus and saves
the Earth.
