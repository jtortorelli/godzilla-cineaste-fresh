title: Gamera vs. Zigra
---

Zigra, a hostile alien, raids one of Earth's moon bases before landing in
Earth's oceans. Zigra abducts a pair of marine biologists and their children,
Ken an Helen. Zigra makes them witness his power to trigger natural disasters at
will. Zigra sends a broadcast to the government and has the biologists testify
to his power. Zigra's servant, a human named Chikako, hypnotizes the biologists.
Ken and Helen outwit her and escape from Zigra's ship with their parents. Zigra
sends Chikako to retrieve the children.

Gamera, the flying turtle monster, appears and attacks Zigra's spaceship. Zigra
himself escapes and grows to enormous size, becoming a monster. Zigra uses an
energy attack to paralyze Gamera. Meanwhile Dr. Sawamoto uses high-frequency
waves to free the biologists from the hypnosis. He uses the same technique to
free Chikako, who is also hypnotized. Chikako reveals that she was a technician
working on the moon base when Zigra attacked. Zigra captured her and used her to
speak on his behalf to the Earthlings. Chikako helps the military devise
countermeasures to deal with Zigra.

The military decides to use lightning to revive Gamera. The biologists descend
in a bathesphere to run a conducting wire to Gamera. Zigra attacks and the
biologists hold him at bay while they complete the plan. Gamera awakes and
rescues the bathesphere. he then attacks Zigra and pulls him out of the ocean.
Gamera pins Zigra with a large boulder and kills him with his flame breath.
