title: The Bullet Train
---

The transportation authority receives a bomb threat against the Hikari 109
bullet train. The usual procedure is to stop the train for a search. The bomber
warns against this since the bomb will detonate when the train slows below 80 km
per hour. The bomber proves his bomb works as designed by destroying a freight
train on another line. The transportation authority has six hours to negotiate
with the bomber. After that, the 109 will reach the end of its line and must
stop, risking an explosion.

Okita, the bomber, demands a ransom payment. He tries to have it left where he
can retrieve it without risking capture. Okita absconds with the ransom and
leaves instructions to find the bomb's schematics. The authorities go to
retrieve the schematics but lose them in a freak accident. Okita prepares to
leave the country, unaware the 109 is still in danger. The authorities use high
speed cameras along the tracks to locate the bomb on the train. They find the
bomb under the second car.

A rescue train comes alongside the 109 with welding equipment. The conductor
burns through the undercarriage of the car to disarm the bomb. The 109 slows to
a stop shortly before it runs out of track. Okita almost makes his flight but
the authorities spot him before he can board. Okita flees through the airport
complex and falls to a policeman's bullet.
