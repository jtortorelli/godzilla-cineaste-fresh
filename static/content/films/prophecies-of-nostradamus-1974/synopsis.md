title: Prophecies of Nostradamus
---

Nishiyama, a pediatrician, observes the effects of pollution on the children in
Tokyo. Nishiyama's colleagues go missing on an expedition to New Guinea, and he
joins a rescue party to find them. When they arrive they find the expedition has
succumbed to radioactive poisoning. Giant creatures infest the island, and the
natives have taken to cannibalism. Nishiyama's family has kept the texts of
Nostradamus and he has studied them his whole life. He believes that these
events signal the approaching apocalypse.

A series of turbojet accidents unleash dangerous chemicals into the air above
Japan. The ozone layer weakens and exposes the populace to harmful levels of
radiation. Spontaneous fires break out and much of the land turns to desert. The
same phenomena has spread around the world, crippling the agricultural industry.
Japan relies on imports for its food, and the government implements rationing.
The populace rebels tries to overturn the rationing program. Riots and more
disasters ensue. Japanâ€™s youth, disillusioned with their future, commits suicide
en masse.

The government considers repealing the rationing program to quell the violence.
Nishiyama disagrees, and meets with the government and community leaders in
Tokyo. He paints a vivid, grim picture of their future if they do not continue
their course of austerity. Things may difficult for them now, but if they do not
act now, they will have no future as a nation. The Prime Minister begs the
Japanese to work together to survive, and take charge of their future.
