title: Rescue Wings
---

Kawashima is a pilot in training for the JASDF Rescue Squad. If she passes
training she'll be the first female pilot in the organization's history.
Kawashima has admired the squad ever since they saved her mother during a
typhoon, many years ago. She's prone to let her emotions distract her, and her
fellow pilots distrust her skills. She has several setbacks. She fails to rescue
a sailor lost at sea, and a girl she did rescue dies in hospital. Kawashima's
superiors send her on paid leave to recuperate. She visits her parents and
reaffirms the reasons why she left for the squad in the first place. She returns
to duty more determined than ever.

Kawashima later flies during a rescue mission on a stranded oil tanker. An
explosion damages the cockpit and injures the senior pilot on board. Kawashima
takes sole control of the chopper. Unable to assist any further at the tanker,
Kawashima accepts another mission. She assists in the search and rescue of a
downed SDF fighter pilot - a friend of the squad. After a lengthy search, the
squad's search jet spots the pilot and marks his location. The pilot is so far
out at sea that Kawashima would not be able to return to base if she attempted
the rescue.

Kawashima decides to take advantage of a naval vessel in the area with a chopper
landing pad. The navy grants permission to land aboard the vessel. They rescue
the pilot and land on the pad, touching down before fuel runs out. Kawashima's
first landing at sea earns her the respect she craves from her squadron.
