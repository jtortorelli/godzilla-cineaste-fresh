Two wounded samurai find refuge in a secluded shrine at the top of a mountain. One samurai awakes in the presence of an older, ragged samurai and his assistant.

A fierce storm is raging outside, and there may still be enemy soldiers about. The younger samurai agrees.

The older samurai tells the legend of a vicious warrior known as Aragami who lives on the mountain. The older samurai then announces that he is that Aragami. The younger samurai is incredulous, until the older samurai demonstrates his supernatural abilities. He also reveals that he had his servant prepare the liver of the dead samurai for the young samurai’s dinner. After eating the prepared liver, the young samurai now has the same powers as Aragami. Aragami has lived too long and seeks a worthy opponent to end his life. Since the young samurai is in Aragami’s debt, Aragami demands the samurai duel with him to the death.

The immortal power of Aragami surges in the samurai, and he revives to resume the duel. Aragami and the samurai clash, only this time the samurai deals the killing blow to Aragami. Aragami accepts his fate and breathes his last. The samurai takes Aragami’s place in the shrine, and becomes the new master of the mountain. Until the next challenger arrives...
