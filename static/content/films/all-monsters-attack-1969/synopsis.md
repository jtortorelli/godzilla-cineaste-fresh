title: All Monsters Attack
---

Ichiro is a lonely boy who spends most his day alone. His parents work long
hours, and the only adult at home in his apartment is an eccentric inventor,
Minami. He passes the time fantasizing about Monster Island. In his daydreams,
he befriends Minilla, the son of Godzilla, and talks with him. They sneak around
Monster Island and watch Godzilla battle other monsters. One of the monsters, a
towering ogre named Gabara, bullies Minilla. Ichiro sympathizes with Minilla,
since he also has a bully, who is also nicknamed "Gabara."

One day Ichiro hides in a warehouse to escape Gabara. He scours the place for
recyclables and finds a driver's license. Unbeknownst to Ichiro, two bank
robbers are hiding out in the abandoned warehouse. The license belongs to one of
them, and they fear Ichiro will lead the police to them. They follow Ichiro back
to his apartment and kidnap him. They steal Minami's car for their eventual
getaway.

While held captive, Ichiro daydreams again of Monster Island. He imagines
Godzilla coming to rescue Minilla from Gabara. Ichiro breaks free and uses the
same techniques as Godzilla to outwit the bank robbers. Minami spots his stolen
car and alerts the police. Ichiro leads the robbers on a chase outside, where
the police snatch them. When Ichiro next encounters Gabara, he fights back and
proves his toughness. Gabara gains respect for Ichiro and becomes his friend.
