title: Godzilla vs. Hedorah
---

A concerned Dr. Yano observes the effects of pollution on the fish in Tokyo Bay.
One fisherman brings him a strange tadpole-like creature made of inorganic
material. Larger tadpoles are responsible for shipping disasters in the waters
around Japan. Yano goes diving to investigate, and one of the tadpoles attacks
him. The scars and burns on Yano's face show that the tadpoles use acidic
attacks. Yano fears that rising pollution encourages the growth of these
creatures. The tadpoles can also combine into a single, giant creature, which he
calls "Hedorah."

Hedorah makes landfall and feeds off toxic factory fumes. Godzilla arrives and
drives it away. Yano experiments with his smaller Hedorha specimens to find the
monster's weakness. He places a small Hedorah between two electrodes. The heat
generated by the electrical charge kills the Hedorah immediately. Yano relays
his findings to the military. The military constructs giant electrodes to use
against Hedorah.

Hedorah appears near Mount Fuji and fights Godzilla. The military lures Hedorah
between their electrodes, and Godzilla pins it down. After several charges, they
succeed in destroying Hedorah. Godzilla trudges back to the ocean, which is
still mired in pollution. Chances are high that a second Hedorah will soon
appear if nothing changes.
