title: Lake of Dracula
---

Akiko and her sister, Natsuko, share a home on the lake, near the fishing
boathouse run by Kyusaku. One day Kyusaku receives a mysterious delivery, which
turns out to be a coffin. Kyusaku's behavior changes and becomes more hostile.
He kidnaps Akiko, bringing her to the boathouse to meet a dark, mysterious man.
A pair of fishermen stumble upon the boathouse and frighten away Kyusaku and his
new master. Akiko tries to convince her boyfriend, Saeki, that she is in danger.
Natsuko undermines her story and causes Saeki to doubt her.

Saeki comes to visit the lake house, but gets called back to the hospital for a
night shift. Natsuko allows the mysterious man into the lakehouse, and he tries
to assault Akiko. Kyusaku attacks Saeki in the road, but a freak lightning storm
kills him instead. Saeki returns to the house and flees with Akiko. They find
Natsuko collapsed in the woods. Both Kyusaku and Natsuko have a set of bite
marks on their necks. Saeki realizes the mysterious man is in fact a vampire.

Akiko recalls an incident in her childhood when she stumbled upon a gothic
mansion by the ocean. They visit the mansion and find the corpse of an old
foreigner. His journal reveals that his own son is the vampire, and that he had
saved Akiko from him many years ago. He had his son confined, but after the son
died he revived as a true vampire, and tortured his father to death. The vampire
reappears and tries to take Akiko to be his new bride. Saeki struggles with the
vampire, causing him to fall and die on an iron spike.
