Zatoichi, a blind masseuse and former yakuza, travels by palanquin. He comes
across a struggling mother, Otoyo, and her infant son. He offers her his
palanquin to make her journey easier. A group of ronin hunting Zatoichi attack
the palanquin, thinking he's inside. Otoyo dies, but the son survives. Zatoichi
feels responsible embarks on a sixty mile journey to the baby's father in
Miyaki.

Zatoichi meetes Ko, a prostitute, who latches onto Zatoichi for his gambling
skills. Zatoichi hires her to help care for the infant. Ko begins to bond with
the child and considers abandoning her trade to remain with them. When they
reach Miyaki, Zatoichi meets Otoyo's husband Unosuke, a local yakuza boss.
Unosuke sent Otoyo away as collateral for a loan, and had no intention of taking
her back. He is now engaged to the daughter of another prominent boss, and wants
nothing to do with the baby. He sends Zatoichi away.

Zatoichi dismisses Ko out of concern for the baby; he does not want her habits
to influence him. Zatoichi wants to raise the baby himself, but a local priest
dissuades him. Zatoichi relents and leaves the baby with the priests at the
temple. Meanwhile, the ronin hunting Zatoichi convince Unosuke to join their
plot. They meet Zatoichi in the woods and attempt to confuse his senses with
drums and torches. Zatoichi remains focused and slays the ronin. He extracts an
apology from Unosuke for his treatment of Otoyo before slaying him, too.
Zatoichi takes his leave of the baby at the temple and departs.
