title: Godzilla vs. Megalon
---

Nuclear tests occur with increasing frequency in the South Pacific. In response,
the undersea nation of Seatopia declares war on the surface. They send their
monster Megalon to destroy civilization, starting with Japan. Seatopian agents
kidnap an inventor, Goro, his brother Rokuro, and friend Hiroshi. They
commandeer his robot Jet-Jaguar use it to guide Megalon on its rampage across
Japan.

Hiroshi escapes his captors and rescues Goro and Rokuro. Goro retakes control of
Jet-Jaguar and sends him to alert Godzilla. Godzilla swims toward Japan while
Jet-Jaguar flies ahead. Jet-Jaguar activates a special protocol to grow in size
until he can face Megalon himself. The Seatopians respond by summoning the space
monster Gigan to assist Megalon.

Megalon and Gigan gain the upper hand against Jet-Jaguar. Godzilla appears and
rescues him, and together they win the battle. Gigan flees back to space and the
Seatopians recall Megalon back underground. Godzilla departs and Jet-Jaguar
shrinks back to normal size to join Goro and his friends.
