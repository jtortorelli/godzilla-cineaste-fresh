title: Gamera vs. Guiron
---

Astronomers detect strange radio waves bombarding Earth. They discover that they
are being sent from the planet Terra on the opposite side of the sun. Two boys,
Tom and Akio, jump at the prospect of contacting aliens. They spot a falling
object with their telescope and discover a UFO in a field near their home. They
board it and activate the controls, causing it to take off and carry them away
from earth. Gamera, the flying turtle monster, spots the UFO and pursues it.

Tom and Akio land on Terra. They witness a fierce battle between a Space Gyaos
and the Terran monster Guiron. Guiron uses its sharp knife shaped head to kill
and dismember the Gyaos. The boys meet a pair of alien women, who probe them for
information about Earth. The women act pleasant but in secret they play to
subjugate earth using Guiron. Gamera arrives and fights Guiron, but Guiron beats
him and sends him to the bottom of a lake. Guiron returns to its pen.

The boys discover the aliens' plans and attempt to escape. The aliens capture
them and continue probing for information on Gamera. The aliens go to repair
their saucer for the imminent invasion. Tom uses a toy dart gun to manipulate
the controls to open their prison. He wakes up and releases Guiron, too, on
accident. Guiron destroys the saucer, killing the alien women. Gamera revives
and fights with Guiron again. The boys find the controls for the aliens' missile
weapon, and fire it at the monsters. Gamera uses it to destroy Guiron. Gamera
welds the saucer back together and uses it to carry the boys home.
