title: The Last War
---

Two nuclear superpowers, the Federation and the Alliance, are fighting a cold
war. Each superpower possesses nuclear arsenals powerful enough to destroy
civilization. Japan's government attempts to mediate the conflict before the
nukes can launch. Although Japan tries to act neutral, they are still part of
the Federation bloc. Any nuclear exchange would make them targets for the
Alliance.

Tamura, a cab driver and family man, goes about his everyday life. He is only
somewhat aware of the global danger presented by the Federation and Alliance.
His daughter, Saeko, is in love with a sailor, Takano. Takano has come back from
his deployment with the navy and asks to marry Saeko. Tamura thinks they are too
young, but his wife Yoshi convinces him and he gives his blessing. The
superpowers come to blows in Korea, and Takano's leave gets cut short. Takano
and Saeko marry the night before he sets sail.

A skirmish in Arctic turns nuclear, and the cold war enters its critical phase.
The Japanese panic and attempt to flee the major city centers. Tamura finally
realizes that the end is nigh and will never realize his ambitions for his
family. Tamura and Yoshi prepare a lavish meal for their younger children. Saeko
and Tamura contact each other one last time by radio and say their farewells.
The nukes launch and all the major cities, including Tokyo, dissolve into
flames. Takano's crew decides to head back to port in Japan, even though it is
still covered in toxic radiation. They would rather die in their homeland than
anywhere else.
