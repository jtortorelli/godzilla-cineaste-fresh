title: Gamera vs. Viras
---

Gamera, the flying turtle monster, patrols space for alien invaders. The Viras
alien race manage to infiltrate Earth and kidnap two small boys, Masao and Jim.
They use the boys as leverage to force Gamera to submit to them. The Viras place
a brainwashing device on Gamera and use him to attack Earth. The military is
powerless against Gamera. Their secondary target is the Viras mothership, but
that is also where the boys are.

The military prepares to surrender to Viras to ensure the boys' survival.
Meanwhile Masao and Jim outwit the Viras and escape their prison. They sabotage
their brainwashing control over Gamera and flee the mothership. Gamera returns
to his senses and advances on the Viras.

The Viras congregate and merge into a single giant Viras, which fights Gamera.
Viras's attacks are vicious, but its body is weak. Viras impales Gamera with its
pointed head, which traps it. Gamera flies high into the atmosphere, where Viras
freezes, and lets it plummet back to earth. Viras crashes into the ocean and
dies.
