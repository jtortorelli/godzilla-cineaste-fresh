title: 'Azumi 2: Death or Love'
---

Azumi and Nagara are two young assassins targeting warlords who threaten the
peace. They've recently assassinated Lord Kiyomasa, and are now pursued by his
vassal, Kanbei. They hide out at a shrine. Azumi goes into the nearby village
for supplies and encounters a gang of bandits. Their leader, Ginkaku, exactly
resembles Azumi's long dead childhood friend Nachi. Azumi struggles to avoid
dwelling on Nachi and projecting her feelings onto Ginkaku. Azumi and Nagara
meet Tenkai the priest. Tenkai's ninjas have kept the warlord Masayuki Sanada pent up
in his castle since the civil war ended ten years ago. Sanada is a sympathizer
with the ill-favored Toyotomi clan, and Azumi's last target. Kozue, one of
Tenkai's ninja's, joins them on their mission.

Kanbei warns Sanada of the young assassins, and he sends his men to ambush
them. Ginkaku and his bandits appear and rescue Azumi from Sanada's men.
Nagara is anxious to fulfill their mission, but Azumi is smitten with Ginkaku.
Kozue convinces Nagara to release Azumi from her obligations so she won't be a
burden to the mission. Nagara pretends to abandon the mission himself and gives
Azumi permission to do the same. When Nagara departs, Kozue betrays him and
kills him. Kozue is actually a ninja of the Kogure clan employed by Sanada.

Kogure ninjas attack Tenkai, and Azumi returns to the mission. Kozue confesses
to killing Nagara and taunts Azumi. Azumi settles the score by killing her in a
duel. Kogure ninjas lay a trap to paralyze Azumi with poison, but Ginkaku saves
her and defeats the ninjas. Ginkaku succumbs to the poison and dies. Azumi has
now lost all her friends and resolves to complete her mission. Sanada is
distraught at the death of his Kogure ninjas and challenges Azumi to a duel.
Tenkai allows the duel to proceed on the condition that all those present accept
the outcome. Azumi duels Sanada and slays him. Kanbei attempts to avenge his
master, but Sanada's men interfere. They have decided to honor the agreement
Tenkai and accept the outcome of the duel. Kanbei sneers as Azumi departs, with
no friends and no home to return to.
