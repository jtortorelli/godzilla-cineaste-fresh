title: 'Goke, Body Snatcher from Hell'
---

A hijacker takes control of a passenger plane, but a UFO appears and causes the
plane to crash in the desert. The hijacker, Teraoka, attempts to flee, but the
UFO abducts him. The aliens aboard the UFO take control of Teraoka and send him
back to kill the surviving passengers. The pilot, Sugisaka, and his attendant,
Asakura, try to organize the survivors. Divisions soon form among them, and
Teraoka takes advantage of the confusion to kill them. Teraoka begins picking
them off one by one, draining them of their blood. He also brings other
passengers to the UFO for the aliens to control.

The aliens speak through one of the passengers, Noriko. She explains that the
aliens are the Gokemidoro. They are invading Earth to exterminate mankind and
stop their constant warmongering. Noriko collapses and dissolves into dust,
completely drained of fluid. The survivors are incredulous and try to capture an
alien to find out more. The plan goes awry and the Gokemidoro take control of
more passengers. Sugisaka traps the possessed survivors inside the fuselage and
set it on fire. He and Asakura flee across the desert.

Sugisaka and Asakura walk until they reach civilization. Every person they
encounter is a dry, crumbling corpse. They were all killed by Gokemidoro and
drained of their blood. Sugisaka realizes that the Gokemidoro have already
attacked all over the Earth. He and Asakura watch as another wave of UFOs
approaches Earth, signaling the end of mankind.
