title: One Missed Call 2
---

Time has passed since the first string of cell phone murders perpetrated by the
ghost Mimiko. The murders have begun again, but a different vengeful spirit
appears to be causing them. Kyoko becomes the latest person to receive the call,
and has three days to live. She meets with a private investigator, Nozoe, who
has traced the origin of the calls to Taiwan. There is a similar string of
murder cases in that country as well, where her ex Yuting is following up for
her. Nozoe, Kyoko, and Kyoko's boyfriend Naoto travel to Taiwan.

In Taiwan they learn the story of Li Li, a girl who had the ability to foretell
death. The people in her village came to believe that she had caused the deaths,
and sealed her away in a cave. They travel to the cave and split up. Nozoe
receives a cursed call, and rushes to find Yuting. Kyoko and Naoto find Li Li's
cavern, where her vengeful spirit dwells. Li Li's spirit attacks them and they
flee to the outside.

Li Li corners Kyoko as her cell phone rings. Naoto answers it instead,
transferring the curse to him and sparing Kyoko. Kyoko watches in horror as Li
Li takes Naoto. Nozoe, meanwhile, assures herself that Yuting is alright. Later,
she realizes that the sequence of events in her memory does not add up, and she
returns to Yuting's place. She finds him dead, along with a video camera that
captured his murder. Where she expected to see herself on film, she sees Mimiko
instead. She realizes that Mimiko possesses her now, and she is continuing the
original curse.
