title: Mothra vs. Godzilla
---

A typhoon washes a giant egg ashore in Japan. Kumayama, an extravagant
businessman, purchases the egg from the local fishermen. He plans to build a
giant incubator around the egg and charge admission to view it. Kumayama
receives funding from Torahata. Kumayama and Torahata receive a visit from the
_Shobijin_, a pair of tiny twin girls. The _Shobijin_ claim the egg belongs to
Mothra and they must return it to Infant Island. The greedy men try to capture
the _Shobijin_ instead. The _Shobijin_ turn instead to a reporter, Sakai, and
his friends to plead their case. Sakai confronts the businessmen with the
_Shobijin_ but is unable to persuade them. The _Shobijin_ return to Infant
Island empty-handed.

Godzilla appears and attacks Japan. Sakai travels to Infant Island to ask the
_Shobijin_ for help. The natives resent the Japanese for coming to them after
denying help to the _Shobijin_. The _Shobijin_ ask Mothra to assist anyway. Even
though Mothra is weak from old age and will die soon, she agrees to help. Mothra
arrives in Japan in time to save her egg from Godzilla, but soon dies from her
injuries. Torahata and Kumayama both die in the ensuing rampage.

The _Shobijin_ pray to the egg and cause it to hatch into twin Mothra larva. The
larva pursue Godzilla and ensnare him in a silk webbing, causing him to tumble
back into the sea. The _Shobijin_ guide the larva and they swim back to Infant
Island.
