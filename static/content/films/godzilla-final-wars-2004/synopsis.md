title: 'Godzilla: Final Wars'
---

Years ago, the Earth Defense Force fought against Godzilla and won, burying him
in the South Pole. In the new century, mutants arise among humanity possessing
super speed and strength. The EDF recruits these mutants to defend against
monster attacks. Ozaki, a mutant soldier, receives orders to escort biologist
Miyuki. Miyuki examines the remains of a mummified monster that shares the same
genes as the mutants. Ozaki and Miyuki receive a vision from the Shobijin, the
twin fairies of Mothra. The Shobijin tell them the mummified monster, Gigan,
fought Mothra eons ago. They gift Ozaki with a crystal dagger. Monsters attack
major cities all over the globe at the same time and the EDF struggles to fight
them off. The monsters are finally vanquished by UFOs. The UFOs, piloted by
X-_seijin_, have also rescued the UN secretary general, Daigo. The X-_seijin_ warn
that a runaway planet, Gorath, is on a collision course with Earth. They request
all Earth's armaments launch to intercept Gorath to prevent Earth's destruction.
Daigo vouches for the X-_seijin_, and promotes an alliance with them.

Miyuki discovers that Daigo is actually an X-_seijin_ in disguise. Furthermore,
"Gorath" is nothing but a hologram. Ozaki recruits his superior, Captain Gordon,
to help expose the X-_seijin_. They force the X-_seijin_ to reveal to the world
their scheme to conquer Earth and feed on humans. The X-_seijin_ unleash the
monsters on Earth, including Gigan, and cripple the EDF. They also assume
control of the mutant EDF soldiers through mind control. Ozaki, for some reason,
is immune to the mind control. Gordon gathers his crew and launches the last
remaining EDF ship, the _Gotengo_. The _Gotengo_ flies to the South Pole and release
Godzilla from his icy prison. Godzilla defeats Gigan and follows the _Gotengo_
back to Japan. The X-_seijin_ send their monsters to intercept Godzilla but none
are able to defeat him.

When Godzilla arrives in Tokyo, the X-_seijin_ summon their last monster, Monster
X, to fight him. They also send a revived Gigan, but Mothra appears and
sacrifices itself to defeat it. The X-_seijin_ captures the _Gotengo_ crew aboard
their mothership. The chief X-_seijin_ reveals that Ozaki is a rare mutant called
a "Keizer," and coerces him into obeying him. Miyuki stabs Ozaki with the
crystal dagger to free him and return him to his senses. Ozaki uses his Keizer
power to defeat the X-_seijin_ and destroy their mothership. Monster X transforms
and drains Godzilla's energy. Ozaki channels his Keizer energy through the
_Gotengo_ to help Godzilla. Godzilla destroys Monster X, and then turns on the
_Gotengo_ and crashes it. The humans stand ready to fight Godzilla to the death.
Minilla, the Son of Godzilla, appears and stands between them to shield the
humans. Godzilla relents and he and Minilla return to the sea.
