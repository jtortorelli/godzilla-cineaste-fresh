title: The H-Man
---

Misaki, a known gangster, disappears during a failed drug run. The police
investigate his disappearance as a homicide. There are no leads and no corpse,
since all that remains of him are his clothes. They interview Misaki's mistress,
Chikako, but learn nothing of value. They also interview Masada, a scientist who
is smitten with Chikako. Masada has a theory that a new, radioactive life form
has appeared. Misaki encountered this creature and it disintegrated him. Masada
presents evidence to the police, but they are reluctant to accept his theory.

Chikako witnesses another disappearance and confirms Masada's theory. A new
liquid life form is on the prowl in Tokyo. Meanwhile the police attempt to trap
the gang leaders at their nightclub. The life form appears and foils the
operation, killing several people. Uchida, the gang leader, fakes his death to
escape the police and kidnaps Chikako as security.

Masada realizes that the life form lives in the sewers. The police attempt to
kill it by filling the sewers with gasoline and igniting it. Uchida takes
Chikako into the sewers to find Misaki's secret drug stash. He recovers the
stash, but disintegrates when the life form attacks. Masada enters the sewer and
rescues Chikako before the flames engulf everything. The fires purge the life
form from the sewers.
