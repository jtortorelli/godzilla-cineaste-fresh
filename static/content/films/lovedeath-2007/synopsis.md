Sai is a young man who becomes enamored with the young and sultry Sheila. They
first crossed paths three years ago, and Sheila has returned to take Sai with
her. Sai is immediately embroiled in a feud between Sheila and the yakuza boss
who claims her as "his girl." Sheila has fled from his gang with the entirety of
the gang's funds, which are still hidden. Sai and Sheila are both taken
prisoner. The gang takes Sai to torture him, and the boss takes Sheila to woo
her back to him. Sai escapes and takes Sheila with him, shooting the boss and
crippling him. The boss dispatches both his own gang and a rival splinter gang,
along with a pair of dirty cops, to track them down.

While on the lam, Sai comes to realize how juvenile and naive Sheila is, and how
foolish he was to fall for her. Sheila doesn't seem to care about the often
lethal trouble she draws others into. She only drug Sai into the thick of things
to help her escape with the money. Sai admits his begrudging affection for
Sheila, which she finds unreasonable.

The yakuza kidnap Sheila and demand Sai return the money in exchange for her.
Sai lays a trap and slaughters them, freeing Sheila and the money. The boss
himself arrives to exact his revenge on Sai, but Sheila runs distraction and Sai
kills him, too. Sheila immediately disappears with the money. Sai retreats back
to his old hangout, but Sheila soon reappears. Moved by his earlier devotion,
she has decided to take him with her on her new adventures.
