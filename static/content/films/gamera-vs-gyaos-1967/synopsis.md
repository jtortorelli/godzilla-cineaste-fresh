title: Gamera vs. Gyaos
---

The evil monster Gyaos appears in the foothills of Mount Fuji. Gyaos comes out
at night to prey on humans and livestock. One night Gyaos threatens a boy and
his village. Gamera, the flying turtle monster, appears and rescues the boy from
Gyaos. The military tries to defeat Gyaos but their weapons are not effective.
Gyaos ventures out to Nagoya, where it causes destruction and continues to prey
on people. Gamera appears again and tries to drag Gyaos into the sea. Gyaos
escapes after letting Gamera rip its foot off.

Scientists recover Gyaos' foot and observe it under UV light. They discover that
Gyaos has a weakness to sunlight, and try to exploit it. They lure Gyaos to a
trap using fake blood, and try to disorient the monster until sunrise. The plan
fails at the last minute, and Gyaos destroys the lure and escapes.

Meanwhile, the villagers at Mount Fuji become despondent. They have nothing left
after Gyaos destroyed their farms and their livestock. They set fire to their
forest to attract Gamera's attention. Gamera returns and duels with Gyaos one
last time. Gamera pins Gyaos and drags it into Mount Fuji. The searing hot lava
kills Gyaos, but Gamera escapes unscathed.
